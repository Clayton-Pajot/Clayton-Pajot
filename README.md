- 👋 Hi, I’m @Clayton-Pajot
- 👀 I’m interested in many things: Coding, D&D, Board games, warhammer and mini painting, playing guitar, and a bunch of other nonsense
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code at Fanshawe College in London Ontario
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever people want to include me in, but I'm still just learning so that may be a bumpy process
- 📫 How to reach me:
